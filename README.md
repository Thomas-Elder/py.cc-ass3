# Cloud Computing - Assignment 3
This is a repository for assignment 3 of RMIT's COSC2639 Cloud Computing course.

## Lifting Web Application
A simple web application deployed on Elastic Beanstalk.

## Lifting API
A simple API implemented with API Gateway. 

Looking into this there as a framework called Severless which makes deployment here a cinch. Have tied a test API into the web app and it works.
